              <p>My interest in coding is rivaled only by my interest in history. Although I have only been programming for six months, I know I have found my true calling. Coding scratches that
                "puzzle solving itch" I've had every day of my life. In June, 2016, I completed the Python Data Science course at The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.
                This was no easy feat; I quit my job of three years and dedicated three months, 60 hours per week, studying and honing my skills as a coder in the basement of The American Tobacco Campus.
                I emerged completely enamored with programming, and am so incredibly excited to explore the many doors of the programming world that have been opened to me.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-4">
              <p>Prior to discovering the joy of programming, I worked in a variety of fields. This diversity of employment is one of my greatest strengths. I am experienced working as part of a team in an office environment,
              know the value of hard manual work (and air-conditioning!) and have tons of experience interacting with clients and translating their needs and concerns. I have a master's degree in History from UNC-Wilmington,
            and the 160-page thesis I wrote is one of my proudest accomplishments. In my free time, I love going to concerts, exploring the culinary scene in the Triangle, taking in a Bulls game, watching a football game or four, or enjoying time with friends.</p>

              <strong>
              My mission is to continue to grow and develop as a programmer, find a position that is, like building Fanta-Sci, too fun to feel like work, and to learn a variety of languages and become a true full-stack developer. My training was centered around the fascinating world of data science, but I am equally interested in honing my web-development chops as well.
